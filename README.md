# Loan Repayment Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

## Overview
This project is designed to predict whether a bank should approve a loan application based on the profitability of the applicant. Using advanced ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and other machine learning methods, this project delivers accurate and interpretable results. The focus is on building a robust, scalable solution for loan approval prediction by processing and analyzing data efficiently.

The project is structured into various steps, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. This structured approach ensures transparency, reproducibility, and usability in real-world applications.
